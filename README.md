### Project Description
[During boring lectures, friends often tell the time as ‚Äúminutes left.‚Äù This site does the same ‚Äî syncing with real time to show only the minutes remaining in the current hour, resetting every 60 minutes like a loop timer.]

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
[Tired of old way of looking time, make a new style for looking time where minitues matter more than hour?]

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
[A timer which runs repeatly for 60 mins,then resets every hour and shows next time with respect to real world time]
